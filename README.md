# Janke Import Assistant

**Client:** Janke Australia \
**Delivery Date:** 19 May 2022

## Description

Collect and collate a combination of assembly/part data and ERP data which is then exported to any common file formats for consumption by Opto Manufacturing.

## Configuration

In order for the application to start correctly, a JSON configuration file is expected in the same directory as the application's binary executable.

The configuration file called `configuration.json` will allow users to:
- Change the user ID for the export
- Change the directory path for Janke CAD drawings
- Add/Remove/Edit paint colours
- Add/Remove/Edit units of measurement
- Add/Remove/Edit work centres
- Add/Remove/Edit component types

A sample configuration file with Janke Australia configuration (accurate as at 28/04/2022) is included in the root of this repository for demonstration purposes.
